## Usage

TODO

## Caught a bug?

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository to your own GitHub account and then [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) it to your local device
2. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
3. Bundle the source code and watch for changes: `npm run dev`
4. Start the app in a new terminal tab: `npm start`

To make sure that your code works in the bundled application, you can generate the binaries like this:

```bash
npm run pack
```

After that, you'll find them in the `./dist` folder!
